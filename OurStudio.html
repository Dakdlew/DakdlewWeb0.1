<p>Dear Sojourner,
<br>
Welcome to our side of the pond.
<br>
<br>
Studio 1201 is a multi-disciplinary design consultancy that merges contemporary technology and timeless design elements to develop unique design solutions.



<br><br>
<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
We aim to cultivate a counter-culture against traditional visual communication. With the constant flow of information via technology, our lives have become saturated with sub-par content. We hope to join forces with those wishing to cultivate success in business and the arts in order to create timeless content.</p>



<br><br>
<h2>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<br><br>
<p>
We design experiences by evoking the human senses through social and cultural values, resulting in unique ways for people to connect. We also believe that design should be strategic. By addressing business goals and vision, we seek to deliver successful metrics based on project performance, economics and measurable impact.
<br><br>
As your design partner, we take seriously the responsibility to help you meet and exceed your project’s metrics for success.
<br><br>
By generating value-oriented design solutions, we determine the highest and best design outcomes creating unique and identifiable experiences.
<br><br>
Our signature process is scalable to each project ranging from Architectural, Fashion Design, User Experience, Branding Development, Visual Marketing, and Graphic Design. This unique methodology consistently delivers exceptional business results for our clients.We thank you for taking the time to visit us, and we hope to see you again.</p>
